Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What didn't work is that I still do not really understand object orientend programming. I underestimated how challenging the transition would be. I did go to TA hours which helped me get some parts of the assignment done, however I should have gone earlier in the week. Although I experienced many challenges, I do feel more confident in my abilities than I did before working on this assignment. Since I'm not completely confident in my performance on this assignment, I plan on continuing my work and resubmitting at a later date.
